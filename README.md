# Portfolio Version 2

This project was undertaken to do a simple update of the webpage that showcases my personal work.
The original page was created from scratch and employs simple HTML and CSS properties. HTML was done as semantically as possible, and CSS was organized via appearance as is custom. The updates to the original portfolio are the following:

## Updates:
- Adding of images for the Main Project
- Adding of images for the Mini Projects
- Adding a brief description of the Main Project
- Adding functioning links for all projects
- Adjustments to spacing of images/content

 
 ## Results & goals for the future
The results of this update were achieved: new completed material was added to my portfolio. In the future I would like to consider adding more interesting interactive elements to the page and have more diverse styling.
